31st of December 2019 was raining in Gothenburg. I spent most of its evening with my lovely wife, telling stories about how amazing our life was during the last 7 months. We were happy as young married couples, finally tasted life in Majorna. Only for 7 months, yes yes, just 7 months. 

The spirit of youngs bloomed during these months were gone in an instant when we had to move in to new apartment in Frölunda. Much calmer, much less crowded, filled with people slight above productive age. Sounds more downgrade than upgrade but actually it is actually very lovely place. Few steps from nature park, close to amazing Frölunda Torg shopping center, few close friends live nearby and lots of dogs <3. So new year's eve was all about us revisiting our life and see what's coming next in 2020. Accompanied by warm sip of tea, we talked about our our reflection on all what we have planned in early 2019 and how much action we took to realize all those plans. Seems like 2020 will be a good fresh start, rethinking what new resolutions to take and in no time, 2019 was over and we started the first day of 2020.
